# Quering Data with SQL
 
This project involves the analysis of customer behavior at a restaurant using SQL. The goal is to understand customer visiting patterns, spending habits, and menu preferences to enhance their dining experience and inform decisions about the customer loyalty program.

This project involves querying data with SQL to provide valuable insights for Mr. Danny, a restaurant owner. By analyzing three key datasets, we aim to help Mr. Danny understand his customers' visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. The findings will assist in delivering a better and more personalized experience for loyal customers and inform decisions regarding the expansion of the existing customer loyalty program.
